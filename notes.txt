I thought maybe it would be cool if we can see:

total cases by week/month

total amount due by week/month in rent 

highlight somehow repeat addresses, repeat tenants?

top ten filers by month?

sort by cares act covered? sort by other protections?

Down the road looking at other info might help....

hotel/motels? (I've seen a few of these lately)

compared to other oscn data ie criminal records/ dv records/filing of debt small claims
